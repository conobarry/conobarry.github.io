            <p>
                I am a soon to be graduate of Computer Science at Aston University, Birmingham, looking to begin a career in software
                development. I have developed in several languages over the course of my education and employment and am always
                eager to learn new technologies. I am a tinkerer and customiser who is always working on an app, script or electronics
                project. I am now looking forward to using and improving my skills at a professional level.
